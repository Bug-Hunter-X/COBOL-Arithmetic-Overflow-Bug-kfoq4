This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in COBOL programs: arithmetic overflow. The `bug.cob` file contains code that attempts to increment a numeric field (WS-AREA-1) beyond its defined maximum value.  This leads to unexpected results because COBOL's handling of such overflows is not always explicit and can vary depending on the compiler. The `bugSolution.cob` file provides a corrected version that handles overflow gracefully.
